# AndroidApp


<p>There are many apps in the market which manages the library books by searching a book name or searching by ISBN number or scan Barcode but only few apps has broader search functionality. For searching the books by book name, by author name and by publications are important attributes. So we have come up with an idea to manage a library app with the best search options and adding books to the cart and wish list. Our target audiences are as follows:StudentsLibrariansBibliophiles </p>
